4 Rules to note before executing BASEC.sh
 
1) Run BASEC.sh in terminal with "./BASEC.sh" without quotes. Do not run as super user. The scripts will ask for su permissions themselves where applicable. Running as su will break functions needed to be run by user.
2) Run BASEC.sh and the complementary scripts in the home directory.
3) Run BASEC.sh on a cleanly installed machine for best results. Any security settings previously changed from the default settings may conflict.
4) Run BASEC.sh in a terminal that snaps to the left or right side of the screen. See SIP video below or BASEC Guide & Scripts gallery for examples. Images will pop up on the right.

BASEC consists of BASEC.sh, the contents of BASEC_Scripts, the contents of BASEC_Pages, and the contents of BASEC_Photos.

Pokedex.sh is a quick access alternative to BASEC.sh that only uses the contents of BASEC_scripts. It's the BASEC scripts without the guide.

BASEC.pdf is a quick access alternative to BASEC.sh. It's the BASEC guide without the scripts, which can be used on any platform vs just Linux.
