PARTITION ENCRYPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Partition encryption is the encryption of each portion of a storage drive. Systems usually only have their own system partitions and require the user to modify the system partitions to create a new partition, unless a system with more than one drive is being used. Such partitions are generally made to sort data by type onto any partition but the systems that 1) data isn’t lost when the system dies and 2) the data can be accessed by more than just one system.

TRUECRYPT ------------------------------------------------------------
TrueCrypt has been a widely-used and recognized partition encryption software up until sometime after the Snowden Revelations. It used on-the-fly encryption with AES256, Serpent, Twofish, or any combination of the three in any order as well as SHA512, SHA256, and Whirlpool hash algorithms. It supports Windows, OS X, Linux, DragonFly BSD, and Android and uses CBC and XTS modes like BitLocker. One reason why TrueCrypt was popular was the creation of hidden partitions. You could create a normal, outer partition with weaker encryption and a weaker, unique security key a hidden, inner partition with stronger encryption and a stronger, unique security key. The hidden partition takes longer to decrypt since entering the password for the hidden partition has to decryption the outer volume first. The reason why you would want to do this is so that, when made to decrypt by whomever, you could decrypt the outer partition without having to expose the files in the hidden partition. There’s only one way of knowing if there’s a hidden partition and it’s up to you if you want to risk it being found or you losing your files. An attacker or law enforcement or whomever can write data to the outer partition, which would either expose that a hidden partition exists when it can’t fill the outer partition completely or would overwrite the inner partition. The latter depends on whether or not you set TrueCrypt to allow the inner partition to be deleted when someone attempts to fill the outer partition fully. Before its support was discontinued, TrueCrypt developers were attempting to get full Windows 8 support, command-line use, and to encrypt system partitions on UEFI when only BIOS was supported. With that said, TrueCrypt wasn’t just used for data partition encryption but system partition encryption as well. You could set it up to encrypt your current Windows system or create a hidden Windows system, which would delete your current system. How the latter works is that in creates a dual partition system just like the outer and inner volumes over standard partitions. You would have to install one copy of Windows on the outer volume and another copy of Windows that you would actually use on the inner volume. TrueCrypt support was killed suspiciously with stating that TrueCrypt is very vulnerable, releasing an update that only allowed users to view partitions and not create new ones, and advising switch over to BitLocker. Gibson Research Corporation decided to complete an audit of TrueCrypt to view whether or not it was insecure or not. It was found to still be secure at the time so it just adds to the suspicion. Regardless, there were several alternatives based directly off of TrueCrypt with added security and support such as VeraCrypt and CipherShed. TrueCrypt also has command-line use alternative under Linux and DragonFly BSD called tc-play.

VERACRYPT ------------------------------------------------------------
VeraCrypt has been called the true child of TrueCrypt, but is only supported on Microsoft, OS X, and Linux and with command-line support. It’s included added technical, security measures and the developers are attempting to add UEFI support. However, they have stated that they will never bother to support *nix systems for hidden, system encryptions. Two phases of an audit already completed showed no malicious code or vulnerabilities. Apart from the aforementioned, it’s identical to TrueCrypt, thus why it has earned being called the true child of TrueCrypt.

CIPHERSHED -----------------------------------------------------------
CipherShed is an incomplete fork of TrueCrypt, yet maintains Windows, OS X, Linux, DragonFly BSD, and Android support. However, it lacks on-the-fly encryption. It’s still in development, but worth noting since its planned to support DragonFly BSD and Android unlike VeraCrypt.
