NETWORKING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As previously stated, the types of networks you use matter. The type of network you should use depends on the network location. For example, when you’re at a coffee shop with free, public Wi-Fi, use the Wi-Fi vs. a wired connection. You can’t hide behind the number of users on a public network if they’re using the wireless network and you’re the only one using the wired network. Granted, it’s unlikely you would have wired access and there’s a lot of security precautions you need to take before even considering joining a public network.

WIRED ----------------------------------------------------------------
Wired networks should be your default networks, especially for home settings. There’s no radio waves for attackers to pick up. In fact, in order to breach your network, an attacker must have physical access to your cables, computer, router, modem, switch, etc. Your neighbor can’t intrude on your network to download the latest episode of Game of Thrones from his home across the street if he can’t access it. Granted, there’s still security precautions that should be taken on a wired network regardless from installing an IDS, establishing firewall rules or using a physical firewall, using MAC filtering, etc. Also, wired networking is faster than wireless networking. You don’t have the same interferences and distant issues over cables. Placing a desktop in a faraday cage to block EMF (electromagnetic frequency (EMSEC issue)) doesn’t disrupt network traffic when wired networks are used, but using Wi-Fi on a desktop with a metal case is just a bad idea since it won’t work with the wireless adaptor inside the case. Wired networks are your best friend like companion cubes!

WIRELESS -------------------------------------------------------------
Wireless networks are inherently insecure, especially compared to wired networks. Your router is broadcasting the networks’ radio waves openly. Encrypting the traffic with WPA2 is a great idea, but doesn’t make you secure enough. If you have a basic, commonly-used password, aircrack-ng can crack your password quickly. If you don’t have MAC filtering set, you can be spoofed or attacked with MiTM attacks, or Man-in-the-Middle. Do NOT disable SSID broadcasting. 1) Your SSID is still broadcasted by the computers connected to the network, 2) it makes it unnecessarily difficult for you to connect to your network when the connection is lost, and, most importantly, 3) it tells attackers you’re new to NETSEC that you don’t know the first point and that your network is still broadcasting radio waves that can be picked up by anyone. Your network is only hidden from network GUIs, not packet analyzers and sniffers. 
Don’t use wireless networks at home unless you either 1) live in such a large home that your network doesn’t broadcast outside your home’s walls or 2) adjust the range to where it only broadcasts as far as the walls within your home. If you live in a dink apartment, don’t even use Wi-Fi. You’d have to limit the range to PAN, or personal area network. That’s a small range that only extends to a small space in a  single room. If you’re adamant about using Wi-Fi, complete Project Honeynet.
