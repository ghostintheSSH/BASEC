CHAT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Chat services are definitely recommended over email addresses, even though sites and services don’t send notifications and recovery information to chat services. They don’t have the same inherent security flaws as email since they don’t use the same vulnerable ports and services. The great news is that there’s myriad, secure chat services from computer to mobile use. BitTorrent’s Bleep, a peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted chat service with cross-platform support, hasn’t been added to the list due to previous issues of delays and difficulties with voice calls. Otherwise, I would add that to the top of the list of recommended chat apps with Signal.
•Signal – mobile, encrypted app with browser support on Chromium / Chrome that uses end-to-end instant messaging replacing your default texting app as your secure texting app. It’s free, open-source, allows group chat, identity auditing with connections, and allows voice calls replacing your phone app as well. It works best if your contacts use Signal too, otherwise connections are not encrypted with non-Signal users. 
•ChatSecure – mobile, encrypted app built on top of Google’s old Talk app with XMPP use. It uses OTR, or off-the-record, encryption and privacy rules and is a part of The Guardian Project, which includes Orbot (Android Tor client), Orfox and Orweb (Android Tor browsers), Ostel (end-to-end encrypted VoIP service), and ObscuraCam previously mentioned in SYSSEC under Android. Until Signal was released, ChatSecure was the highest recommended mobile, encrypted chat service.
•IRC – an old chat service still used today that can be secure or not depending on the user’s configuration. In fact, it’s not like the other services listed here since it’s not a chat service that was built with encryption in mind. Internet Relay Chat is mid-‘90s tech that uses channels and peer-to-peer connections with each client requiring a server to communicate. However, it offers way too many options in-chat to ever be discounted from creating secret channels to establishing channel operators and from making users invisible to banning users from channels. Mr. Robot has shown that IRC hasn’t lost any of its power or sleekness. 
•CryptoCat – a browser-based, end-to-end encrypted IM service that’s open-source and free. It’s a great tool that’s been recommended numerous times, but previous uses with others show that it’s apparently not an easy-to-understand service from not figuring out how to install the extension to not knowing the difference between the chatroom name and usernames. 
•hack.chat – a browser-based, minimalist IM service that uses HTTPS encryption, custom channel support, and includes Android apps if you don’t want to use the mobile browser. It functions through the hack.chat site with custom channel names at the end of the URL so no installations are needed. It’s certainly light enough not to need an app so I don’t recommend installing one for Android, but hack.chat is a lightweight alternative to CryptoCat that’s too difficult for users not to understand how to use it. 
•FireChat – mobile, peer-to-peer IM service that’s neither encrypted nor uses an Internet connection. In fact, it uses mesh networking with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Apple’s Multipeer Connectivity Framework. It’s a chat service that’s meant for local use and has proven great for communicating during protests when authorities block Internet connections. 
•Jitsi / Pidgin – both services are free, open-source IM services that are cross-platform on computers with multiple communication types support like XMPP and use OTR encryption and privacy rules. However, Jitsi also has Android support.
•Tox – cross-platform, end-to-end encrypted, peer-to-peer IM and voice calling chat service that’s free and open-source. If you want a secure IM service that’s cross-paltform, this is your best option since it has Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, iOS, Sailfish, and FreeBSD support.
