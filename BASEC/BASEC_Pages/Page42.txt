NETSEC
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NETSEC is network Security. Like SYSSEC, this is one of the most discussed types of cyber security. However, excluding the technical aspects, a lot of NETSEC-related issues can be solved with PERSEC from social engineering awareness to safe browsing habits. The technical side of NETSEC still matters though and will provide additional security PERSEC cannot. This ranges from browser plugins to encrypted traffic and from the network type to firewall rules. NETSEC matters because you’re opening your system to every network you connect to and the users on those networks exponentially increasing security risks you wouldn’t find with SYSSEC and PERSEC in an offline world. Your online presence makes you a great target and you will be targeted.
There’s a lot of confusion with the dark web, dark net, and deep web. Let me break it down. There’s the Clearnet and the dark net and then there’s the surface web, deep web, and dark web. There’s also dark Internet, but that only applies to servers online that can’t be connected to in any way, shape, of form. Clearnet is the use of networking without encrypting network traffic and dark net is the exact opposite encrypting network traffic. Surface web is the part of the web where contents are indexed and accessible by search engines and the deep web is the polar opposite where contents can’t be indexed by search engines. Dark web’s definition is unclear and constantly argued about. My definition has been the use of dark net services over the web like Tor. Wikipedia’s definition is the use of the web over dark nets. It’s really the same definition. It’s the part of the web that’s only accessible via dark net services like Tor and I2P. It’s argued that the dark web is a small part of the deep web, but that’s untrue since many dark webs sites are accessible to multiple dark web search engines.
