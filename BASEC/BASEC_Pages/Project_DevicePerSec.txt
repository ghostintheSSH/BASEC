PROJECT DEVICE PERSEC
 
Qubes OS is the easiest alternative to this project, but if you’re new to Linux, you may want to put off testing Qubes OS until you have a decent amount of experience. It will be covered further in SYSSEC under Other Linux.
01)Switch to a Linux host if it’s not already your host.
02)Create a list of accounts and services you currently use.
03)Categorize list of accounts and services by type. For example, Chase and Amazon are financial-related services and should be separated from Facebook and Twitter accounts.
04)Download and set-up virtualization software.
05)Create and configure VMs for each account and services category.
06)Configure guest OS of VMs by diagram or own use.
07)Create new, encrypted email addresses for each category.
08)Separate previous accounts and services to new addresses. Never log onto accounts on a VM that isn’t the specific VM type.
09)Delete accounts and services not separated and delete email account from which the other accounts were separated. For example, if a single Gmail account was used to house all account types and account types were separated to ProtonMail, then delete Gmail account once separation is completed.
10)Create additional, secure VM for general browsing to keep data off of host.
11)DO NOT LOG ONTO ACCOUNTS VIA HOST.
