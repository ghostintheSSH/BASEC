EMAIL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, you need disposable email addresses. I use these before I use Fake Name Generator since even creating an identity isn’t as necessary and more time consuming that obtaining a temporary email address. Some sites flag them as illegitimate accounts and block them. However, they’re a great way of avoiding spam, not giving up your PII, and not giving up one of your email addresses when a site is requiring you to join them to use their service. I’ve added my own options further down the list due to the issue of some of these services being flagged as illegitimate and blocked. There’s a lot more disposable email services that you could imagine, but I’ll only cover the key few. I’ve ignored 10 Minute Mail, My Trash Mail, and Temp Inbox because they’re lackluster in comparison to the few chosen.

DISPOSABLE EMAIL -----------------------------------------------------
•Guerrilla Mail: Sends and receives mail with attachments, has browser and Android support., saves mail for 1 hour, is not secure, generates new address each visit or allows user to input address, allows domain selection, and scrambles address. The differences between free and premium accounts are that the premium accounts allow custom domain selection, includes privacy features, bypasses blockades, and remains easy to use with just entering the Name Server and allowing Guerrilla Main to do the rest. 
•Mailinator: Only receives mail for disposable option, has browser, Google, and Slack support, deletes after a “few” hours, is not secure, requires user to generate address allows domain selection, and scrambles address. The differences between free and premium accounts are that free accounts aren’t secure, it saves nothing for more than a day, and allows many alternate domains. Premium accounts vary on the amount they offer, but they include storage, several thousand emails a day, private domain use, API access, and it saves messages. 
•Inbound+: Only receives mail, has browser support, saves mail for 24 hours, can only hold 10 emails, is not secure, generates new address each visit so long as cache and cookies are cleared or allows user to input address, does not allow domain selection, and does no scramble address. The difference between Inbound+ and the previously mentioned options is that it doesn’t have a premium account option. Inbound+ was only chosen because it’s used by Fake Name Generator vs. Guerrilla Mail like Fakena.me.

ENCRYPTED EMAIL ------------------------------------------------------
I’m only covering one aspect of encrypted email in conjunction with disposable email services. Encrypted email is fully discussed in NETSEC under Email. I’ve been annoyed at times when I’m in a hurry and a temporary email service doesn’t work because it’s been blocked whether the service I signed up for explicitly states such or just never sends the confirmation email to the temp address. One sure-fire I’ve come to combat this issue is to use Tutanota or ProtonMail; two highly trusted, encrypted email service providers. They’re easy to set up, require no PII verification since privacy is one of their primary principles, is secure, and can be easily deleted once finished, especially Tutanota. It’s not my first choice since I have to spend time creating the account and I’m wasting an email address another user may want. However, both are accepted since they aren’t primarily used for fake data or creating temporary accounts for single-purpose usage like disposable email services. It’s a thought to consider if you want to use a temporary email address on a site that’s blocked disposable emails, yet you don’t want to sign up for an email address that makes you prove your identity.
