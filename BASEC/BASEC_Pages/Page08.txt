PRIVACY MAINTENANCE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that you know how to obfuscate and delete your actual PII and create PII, let’s talk about maintaining privacy. Screwing up at this level makes everything else you’ve done with the last chapters useless, assuming you’ve been making changes or notes throughout your reading. I can keep and maintain my privacy, but I can’t do it for the people around me. A friend or relative sharing your information, intentionally or not, can undo everything. You can start by asking them not to do so, but you can finish by making sure they have no information to share. I use an email address on a disposable virtual machine to keep in contact with my family, especially since the last encounter using a primary account led to multiple forms of spam and social engineering attempts. They were using the share feature on some relatively unknown site vs copying and pasting the URL into an email, which is also not a good idea but nowhere near as bad. Another issue might actually be yourself. Don’t ever post hard PII and avoid posting soft PII. Hard PII is the PII we’ve discussed previously like your address, full name, phone number, SSN, etc. Soft PII is stuff like favorite colors, movies, hobbies, etc. All of these identify you as a person. If you want to share this information, then you have to accept the consequences of losing your privacy. 

GOOGLE ---------------------------------------------------------------
I highly recommend avoid using Google for as much as possible. They might have better services than Yahoo!, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and more and they may allow you control over your data, but you have to trust Google to not be evil. They’re very good at data aggregation and analysis. You don’t need a YouTube account to watch most YouTube videos and you don’t need to subscribe to videos via an account when RSS exists. Google Drive isn’t an encrypted cloud storage service, Google Docs has poor quality in comparison to MicroSoft Office, Gmail isn’t encrypted and Google reads your emails, you don’t need an account to use Chrome Web Store, etc. Using Android without a Google account is difficult though. While Google doesn’t encrypt emails, it does have PGP support. The only issue is that PGP has a learning curve, but this will be discussed in later in the chapter under Encryption. Google does have some uses even though alternatives exist. In fact, the only real pro Google offers is cross-service integration. One of the few uses is setting up Google Alerts to notify you when a change has been made to your online PII like if a directory site adds your information. Another is for Google Calendar with reminders if you can’t use local alternatives. Reminders such as password frequency rotation deadline, but this will be discussed later in this chapter in Password Manager.
If you’re going to use Google, I have some suggestions, all of which are under your account settings:
•Use a recovery email specifically for security uses like recovery.
•Don’t add your phone to recovery list.
•Make security answer irrelevant to security question.
•Check your connected devices regularly.
•Regularly check your account permissions. Remove what you haven’t used in 30 days and / or will not use in the foreseeable future.
•Check your app passwords. If you’re using 2FA and email through any email app that’s not Gmail, you need to generate an app password so you can still access your Gmail through that app.
•Don’t use Gmail, especially with secure, private, encrypted emails out there.
•Keep your 2FA up-to-date. Keep list of back-up codes in a txt file encrypted with whatever service that uses AES256 like AES Crypt. This will be discussed further later in the chapter under Encryption.
•Review what public information you’re giving.
•Disable or pause all Google activity such as YouTube watch history.
•Disable ads based on your interests.
•Delete Google services not in use and their data.
•Set up Inactive Account Manager.

PHOTOS ---------------------------------------------------------------
Don’t post personal photos of yourself online. If you do so, then make sure to obscure the data first. We’re talking about adding layers onto layers, pixelating, creating glitch art, and / or blurring images while always removing EXIF data. Using photoshop to make your face into a swirl is reversible and has been used by the FBI against a suspected pedophile. Good for them for catching a criminal, but we already know thanks to the Snowden Revelations that triple-letter agencies don’t make the distinction between criminal and law-abiding citizens when data harvesting. Especially don’t use camera phones. Digital cameras are bad enough with metadata, but smartphones include geolocation data too. Both give the date and time of the photo taken, the make and model of the device used to take the photo, the dimensions of the photo, and more. Some mobile apps like Obscuracam exist to wipe metadata, but it replaces the metadata with new metadata stating the original metadata was removed by Obscuracam and this will be further discussed in SYSSEC under Mobile. If you take photos on your phone, privately and securely transfer them to your computer. Use EXIFTool to wipe the EXIF data or metadata. It doesn’t replace the original metadata with new metadata but scrubs it completely short of size dimensions. I prefer to blur my face, add an image over my face, take pics with my face already covered, pixelate my pics, or blur them so all of them can’t be used to identify me.

ACCOUNTS -------------------------------------------------------------
Don’t use social media. They’re not really secure and the people close to you should know your email and / or phone number. Especially don’t use social media services that don’t give you robust security options. I don’t recommend blogging or vlogging either, but therein lies the distinction. Do you use social media for social interaction with friends and / or family or are you using it for professional purposes? You have to accept the consequences of the latter, but the former is an avoidable vulnerability you’re needlessly adding to your digital life. 
Try to maintain as few accounts as possible. The more accounts you have, the harder it is to manage them. I suggest compartmentalizing your accounts and separating by use on different email account and VMs, which will be discussed later in the chapter under Virtualization. Delete what you don’t use regularly. Before deleting the account, delete all of the data on the accounts and obfuscate what can’t be deleted.
