FIREWALL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Firewalls are undeniably the most critical aspect of NETSEC that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic on the given network or network connection. It’s the filter that can keep your apps and programs from leaking your data online and stop attackers from intruding on your network. Where you set up firewalls on your network matter. Placing it outside your network makes it accessible to attackers, placing it beside your network gives attackers the choice to bypass it, and integrating it with the network can lead to configuration problems if not done properly. It’s generally recommended to place the firewall just within the network acting as a barrier between your router and your devices, but you can configure it within the router too so long as you have firewall configuration experience. There are two types of firewalls: network firewalls and host-based firewalls. You would know these as hardware and software firewalls. The network / hardware firewalls are software firewalls acting on computer hardware whether bought as a firewall or created with routers or Raspberry Pis. The host-based firewalls are the software generally found on your computer. For Linux, I recommend UFW. For Windows, I recommend firewall apps because Windows Defender sucks. You could also go out of your way and construct your own.

UFW / IPTABLES -------------------------------------------------------
ufw is the uncomplicated firewall, which is a CLI tool. If you want the GUI version, install Gufw too. It’s a Linux firewall tool that uses iptables for configuration and iptables is a Linux kernel firewall to configure rules over tables it chains and saves. Instead of saving rules individually, they are chained together in sequences over a table, which is why you won’t see the latest rule changes necessarily at the bottom of iptables. G / ufw has IPv6 support, reports status, has verbose logging, allows app integration, sets default policies (set ‘deny all’ as default), rejects incoming rules, allows different logging levels, has bash support, has reset options, and more. G / ufw are the ‘it’ Linux firewalls to use, but they require a bit of knowledge and experience in both setting up firewalls and how to use. They’re not as friendly as app firewalls.

BITDEFENDER ----------------------------------------------------------
If you’re already using Windows and you’re cautious about malware, purchase the BitDefender Security Suite. Prices vary, but I’ll let you research that since they offer more than one product, multiple licenses, and prices do vary over time. It’s not the greatest at malware scanning, but all AVs are horribly ineffective at malware protection. Remember, it’s a security suite that’s awesome for reasons unrelated to its AV functions. In this case, it would be the app firewall that’s easy-to-use and non-intrusive. 
BitDefender’s firewall uses four network types of trusted, home / office, public, and untrusted, three stealth modes of on, off, and remote, whether or not you want to use generic settings, and views incoming and outgoing network data. Adding firewall rules can use any combination of network types, allows local and remote addresses, and event types of listening, traffic, and connecting. Each rule can be set with TCP, UDP, or any protocol types, inbound, outbound, or both types of traffic, IPv4, IPv6, or both IP versions, and whether or not the rule permits or blocks traffic with the rule settings. After setting up the rules, you can view firewall logs under firewall events. The logs will include the application with file path, protocol used, port accessed, whether or not BitDefender permitted or blocked the traffic, and the date and time of the event. If you’re already using Windows and need an AV, why not use BitDefender?

TINYWALL -------------------------------------------------------------
TinyWall is an easy-to-use, lightweight, non-intrusive app firewall for Windows. If your intention was to have an app firewall that was single-serving and not part of a security suite, then you found your best solution. TinyWall doesn’t need you to understand ports, protocols, and app details to function and doesn’t use constant pop-ups. What it includes is automatic learning mode, firewall tampering protection, settings lockdown via password, quick modes, host file protection, IPv6 support, view ports and port statuses on your machine, and more. It works with Windows Firewall to function as a firewall without the terrible default configuration or learning curve required to use it. In this regard, TinyWall is great for the layman. However, it’s also great for when you’re in a hurry and need security like Pokedex.sh is to BASEC.sh.
