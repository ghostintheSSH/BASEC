PROJECT RFID / GPS
 
PROJECT HONEYDRIVE only works for dumb thieves that boot the system without removing the drives and placing the drives into a write-blocker. PROJECT RFID / GPS is a conceptual project for stopping smart thieves.

01)Purchase 2 RFID chips, 1 GPS chip, and 1 GPS antenna. You’ll need equipment small enough to hide in the laptop. Use a box to conceal everything but the antenna for desktops. If metal case is used for either type, antenna needs to partially stick out to broadcast.
02)Purchase electrical equipment: wire, switch, battery, solder, soldering iron, wire stripper, anti-static wristband, electrical tape, etc.
03)Wire chips, battery, and switch together by the diagram. 
04)Configure RFID chips to interact with each other. Set 2nd RFID chip on person. Set 1st RFID chip to activate switch when 2nd RFID chip leaves proximity.
05)Set GPS chip to broadcast to security server, a phone, or user account.
