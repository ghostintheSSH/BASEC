VIRTUALIZATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
VMs, or virtual machines, are great for a large number of reasons. You can use other operating systems simultaneously with your main system, you can test software or configurations on a guest OS (VM; main OS is host OS) that could break the guest OS without it breaking the host, you can set up a network of systems to communicate while on one computer, you can go online without as much concern for malware or cyber-attacks without the host OS usually being affected, and more. The one drawback worth noting is that using hypervisors can eat up a lot of your system resources so you need to test and configure your VMs properly and not run them on cheap machines that lack any real computational power. Since my host OS is a Linux distro and I need to use a current version of Microsoft Office, I have a VM set up with Windows 10 to run MS Office 2016. However, there’s still more reasons for virtualization. In the context of PERSEC, we need VMs so we can use separated systems on a single machine without the systems necessarily being connected to each other. Previously, under Accounts, I stated that account types need to be separated with different email addresses and systems. Create a Linux VM and encrypted email account for your finances and transfer your finance-related emails and accounts to the new email account that you only access via the VM. Do not use mobile banking apps and be cognizant of what’s connected to what. This will be covered later in this chapter under Finances.

VIRTUALBOX -----------------------------------------------------------
VirtualBox is a free and open-source hypervisor commonly used in the *nix community for creating, maintaining, and using VMs. It doesn’t have the prettiest design nor does it have all the robust features most VMware products have, but it’s still extremely useful for many people. It can be used on Windows, OS X, Linux, and Solaris. It’s much easier to install OS X on than VMware Workstation, is a lot lighter and easier to configure than VMware Workstation, and has an active development community. However, VirtualBox is also owned by Oracle and has closed-source USB drivers and cannot issue commercial licenses for said drivers. If your intent is to keep Windows as your host OS and use Linux as your guest OS in your VMs, then this might be the better choice for you.

VMWARE WORKSTATION ---------------------------------------------------
VMware Workstation is just one of many of VMware’s products. Unlike VirtualBox, VMware Workstation is neither free nor open-source, but it is a professional-grade hypervisor. It can be used on Windows and Linux. VMware Player is free, but lacks the features VirtualBox has so the best option for trying to spend nothing is VirtualBox. Otherwise, choose VMware Workstation or any one of VMware’s greater products. VMware can sell commercial licenses and has well-established third-party development and distribution programs. If your intent is to use Windows or Linux as your host OS, use Linux and Windows as your guest OS in your VMs with better networking capabilities and more features, and spend over $200 to do so, then this might be the better choice for you. I haven’t used VirtualBox in several years and I don’t plan on going back. The last time I did, the networking capabilities proved loo limited to make use of, but I use VMware for a lot more than Project Device PerSec.
