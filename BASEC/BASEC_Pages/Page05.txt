ONLINE IDENTITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Let’s start by talking about how using your real, full name online is bad idea. Are you a professional contractor? Are you an artist trying to get your name out there to sell your work? Balance of probability states you’re a social media user that has absolutely no reason putting your real, full name online. Ross Ulbricht learned this lesson the hard way when he promoted Silk Road in the beginning with invitations that could only be received by emailing him and the email address used his full name. Many platforms do allow you to create random usernames vs using a person’s name. Social media is already advised against for both security and privacy purposes. However, if you have to have an account, I normally suggest tweaking the first or last name to a nickname. A friend named Zach loved Jack Daniels so we called him Zach Daniels. The surname is an actual last name that social media sites will accept. Otherwise, it’s suggested you either create a fake online persona or use a service to do so like Fake Name Generator. 

FAKE NAME GENERATOR --------------------------------------------------
Fake Name Generator creates fake identities in full at random. It creates information from name to the make and model of the car you drive and from your geolocation coordinates to your blood type. The bare essentials include: name, gender, DOB, SSN, address, city, state, zip, phone number, username, password, and email address. The email address is a disposable email address created using Inbound+. It’s a useful tool for obfuscating your actual PII and there’s plenty of reasons, unfortunately, that you need to lie about your identity from non-government-sanctioned entities. One such reason is privacy from stalkers. Another reason is from telemetry services: smart, digital stalker services. Telemetry is actually the means of collecting user data, compiling data, and creating a user profile based on the collected and compiled data. It’s how companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. can target what services you may like better. When you create single-use, disposable accounts that require some form of PII and you don’t want to create the identity yourself., Fake Name Generator should be your go-to tool. 

FAKENA.ME ------------------------------------------------------------
A less feature-rich alternative is fakena.me. It doesn’t include the additional information that would most likely be needed such as blood type, car make and model, favorite color, current employment with position, credit card information, etc. What it creates are the bare essentials already covered by Fake Name Generator: name, gender, DOB, SSN, address, city, state, zip, phone number, username, password, and email address. The email address is a disposable email address created using Guerrilla Mail, but without the Guerrilla Mail domains that large, popular sites may have flagged as illegitimate.

DELETE ME ------------------------------------------------------------
We were previously acting under the pretense that you wanted to create an identity to engage online. What if you wanted your actual identity to not be found through digital reconnaissance? You can either 1) scour each directory site and opt out to have your identity listed or 2) use a service like DeleteMe. The latter collects and removes your data from these directories and other online sites from comments to photos, blocks data collectors, and generates reports. DeleteMe is not free and you have to trust that it doesn’t retain your PII as it scours the Internet to delete your PII for you. A lot of reviews have stated this service to be effective, yet unnecessary. It costs $130 annually, which means its usage is limited to that timeframe. It’s great if you’re in a hurry, don’t want to deal with the research and opting out, and you just have money to burn. Otherwise, research the people-finding directories yourself, try to find yourself on each, and get them to take it down where applicable. This option is costly in time whereas DeleteMe is costly in money. 
There is a third option. It’s easier to do, completely legal even though it wouldn’t seem like it, and still keeps you secure. Obfuscate your PII with spelling mistakes. Kent Adams is Kent Addams, Ken Adams, Ken Addams, Kent Adam, Kent Addam, Ken Adam, Kent Addams, etc. and those are just playing on the t, d, and s in the name. It makes it harder for people to find you. Another option with obfuscation is beyond the basics of BASEC with creating shell corporations and placing your finances and assets under the company or creating an actual company and doing the same. You can’t find Kent Adams if all of his bills and PII are actually under Acting Enterprises, Ltd. How would you know to make that connection unless you actually knew the person well enough to know that’s their company? These are just a few ways of keeping your PII private.
