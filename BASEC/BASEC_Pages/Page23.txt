AUTOMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Automation plays a huge part in how we use our systems. After all, the way we develop computers is to make our lives easier by handling mundane tasks that could otherwise be automated or simplified. We wouldn’t need a computer to solve great logical problems if we could do the same with a pen and paper. IoT, or Internet of Things, exists for just this purpose, but there’s no use in tackling that security mess until the basics of security are understood. Instead, let’s focus on the automation tools that exist already on your systems and how they could be used. 

CRON -----------------------------------------------------------------
Cron is a great automation tool preinstalled on Linux systems to run commands and / or scripts based on time including hour, minute, day, month, and workday. It’s accessed by opening a terminal and entering “crontab –e” without quotes, but trying to edit the crontab file under /etc does nothing since Cron will create its own crontab file. Scripts ran need their full paths written so “~/SCRIPT” won’t function properly like “/home/USER/SCRIPT” would. If root permissions are needed, then use “sudo crontab –e” without quotes to access the root crontab file without having to enter the same command in the user crontab file with the user’s password. How you enter a time is by entering data in all five points that appears as “* * * * *” without quotes and with spaces between each point. Only use the asterisks for time ranges you don’t want to specify. For example, I run Bleachbit every night at 11:55, which appears as “55 23 * * * bleachbit COMMAND” in the crontab file. “55” indicates at 55 minutes into the hour, 23 means 11PM since *nix systems use a 24-hour clock, and the three asterisks that follow means day, month, and weekday aren’t specified so the cronjob is run every day. Cronjobs can also be specified to run at certain time ranges and repeatedly without repeating the command. For example, “0,30 0-23 * * 0 COMMAND” runs a command every Sunday every half hour for every hour, which could also be ran with only defining the “0,30” aspect. I don’t use cron to run maintenance and cleaning every night but system updates, powering off the machine for the night, running clamav, setting up Conky configurations, backing up Firefox bookmarks, running BitTorrent Sync to back up data, dismount encrypted data partitions, etc. By automating maintenance, back-ups, and security tools, you can keep your machine secure with little interaction and Cron is definitely a capable automation tool. 

TASK SCHEDULER -------------------------------------------------------
Task Scheduler is the Cron for Windows, but comes with a GUI unlike Cron. Actually, Task Scheduler is a lot more feature-rich than Cron by running commands using the same schedule criteria, when a specific system event occurs, when the system becomes idle, when the system is booted, when the user logs on, and more. It can be accessed under the following tree:
Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools > Task Scheduler
The process of setting up a task is even easier here than on Cron. However, like Cron, you’re expected to know commands and scripts in order to make use of certain functions. I have my Windows VM set up to save my Microsoft Office Work at 23:30 and then shut down. If I wanted to run Bleachbit, I would use the easy set-up to configure the schedule to run Bleachbit and then I would enter “bleachbit_console.exe --clean –preset” to run Bleachbit. You’ll have to look into the command for each program you want to run at a specific time.
