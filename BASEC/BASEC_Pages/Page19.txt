FILE ENCRYPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Next is encrypting files themselves and not just the system and partitions on which they can be found. Any file that is a file can be encrypted. A folder has to be compressed into any compression file like a zip in order to be encrypted.

PGP / GnuPG ----------------------------------------------------------
PGP is Pretty Good Privacy. It’s a data encryption / decryption tool for digitally signing files of all sorts, especially email, and was created by Phil Zimmerman. Due to copyright issues, it led to the creation of OpenPGP. While Symantec now owns PGP, there is a widely-used and recognized, open-source alternative called GnuPG, or GNU Privacy Guard. While GnuPG is Linux-focused, it’s cross-platform with different names per OS. It’s called GPG4Win for Windows, iGolder for web, and MacGPG on OS X; it’s still GnuPG on Android since Android is based on Linux. If you want to encrypt your emails without using an encrypted email service provider, want to encrypt your files, or you want to use pwd.sh, then you will need to install GnuPG (or any alternative for files like AES Crypt). GnuPG is just the CLI (command line interface) form though on Linux. In order to have a GUI (graphical user interface) on Linux, you need to install the appropriate package for whichever DE (desktop environment) you’re using like Seahorse for Gnome or KGPG for KDE. It’s revered for its functionality and support across numerous services. It’s works with the Enigmail mail extension on Thunderbird, Firefox, Chrome, and SeaMonkey, email clients like Thunderbird, KMail, Outlook, Evolution, instant messaging services like Psi and Fire, secure file signatures in place of hashes, and more. You already hear about PGP anymore since Symantec bought it, but OpenPGP standards still exist that keeps the name in our minds. Otherwise, it’s GnuPG. 

AES CRYPT ------------------------------------------------------------
AES Crypt is another favorite encryption tool of mine and it’s solely for using AES256 on files. It cannot encrypt a folder, but it can encrypt a zip file so just compress whatever folder you want to encrypt. It supports Windows, Linux, OS X, Java, C#, and Andriod, but it’s called Crypt4All on Android. It can be used via CLI, but it’s mostly supported to be used by side-clicking any file and selecting AES Crypt from the menu of options. Doing this will bring up a window prompting for password to encrypt the file. You can set the file type to open AES Crypt by default, but it’s not recommended. As previously stated under Self-Created Safe under Passwords, using AES Crypt will generate a new file. It would appear all file encryption tools do this in case you still need the plaintext file on an error occurs during the encryption process. While I don’t recommend setting AES Crypt to be the default tool to open any editable file, the .aes file created does open AES Crypt by default as would be expected. Don’t lose your password.
