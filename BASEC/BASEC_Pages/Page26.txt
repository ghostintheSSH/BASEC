Cache, history, cookies, temp files, etc. are bits of data that should be actively and routinely removed. These files store information relating to your activities that may reveal your digital footprint. It’s best to make sure applications you use never store this information. In the Browser section, with Firefox, I explain my set-up and how no information beyond cookies are saved and an add-on I have to immediately delete cookies. However, it’s not for everyone and some may want to save their browsing history to find a previously-visited link later. Excluding browsers, a lot of our applications create cache that isn’t necessary outside of your current session. There are a few tools that exist to take care of this issue.

BLEACHBIT ------------------------------------------------------------
Bleachbit exists on Linux and Windows. On Linux, it’s a great application that takes care of a lot of temporary files created, utilizes *nix commands to remove outdated packages, and can be used via terminal (read: you can code it to work in cronjobs). On Windows, it’s pretty good, but it falls short to CCleaner and NCleaner. However, CCleaner and NCleaner lack the options to free disk space by eating up all the free space, grabbing whatever scraps of data it can find, and deleting the large file to creates in the process. For Windows use, it’s best to use it alongside NCleaner. 
Bleachbit can be customized via CLI or GUI to run certain options. Freeing up disk space is great, but this step can take a very long time depending on your CPU and storage space. A 2TB HDD on an i7-3630 quadcore CPU at 2.4GHz takes several hours. I only use this feature weekly or monthly due to the long time constraint. What Bleachbit can remove includes cache, cookies, form history (auto-fill), passwords, DOM storage, clipboard, recent documents list, memory, trash, broken files, CLI history, etc. One additional difference between the Linux and Windows version is that the Linux requires two different instances for information it can delete: user and root. Run root first or, if using cronjobs, set the root job to run before the user job. This will be discussed in Cronjobs. Bleachbit can also be set to only run against specified partitions in settings. 

NCLEANER -------------------------------------------------------------
NCleaner exists on Windows only. It’s a great cleaning, privacy, security, and management application that blows CCleaner out of the water. It’s also a double-edged sword. There are parts of the application that can be adjusted for better management and security of your Windows OS, but it doesn’t go into detail for some functions. While there are short descriptions of each setting, there’s no warning of how changing said setting may break your system if you’re new to the app. I’ve broken BitDefender numerous times from failing to exclude needed files from the “Find Junk” section. Changes in “Tweak” or “Startup Mon” can either be very useful or break necessary system services. Use at your own risk. It’s recommended over CCleaner since it’s a lot more feature rich and useful. Excluding freeing up disk space, it can do everything Bleachbit can and more. It only uses a GUI and it provides a Security Advisor at the top of the app to signal necessary changes needed to be made.  Windows applications can also be automated like Linux as specified in Cronjobs. Like Bleachbit, NCleaner can be set to only run against specified drive letters.
