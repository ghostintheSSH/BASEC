PHYSICAL SECURITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Physical security is another large aspect that often goes ignored, but it’s specific to SYSSEC and easy to set up. The first suggestion is to invest in Kensington cable locks to keep laptops, desktops, and monitors from being stolen. If you’re extra concerned, you can always place your systems in locked, ventilated cabinets. As long as the heat can dissipate, you shouldn’t have an issue. Incognito Toolkit has a few suggestions, of which I’ve modified and added a few, of constantly checking your peripheral cables, placing fingernail polish on screws to see if touched, placing a small scrap of paper into a phone case to see if opened, making markings and engravings to identify your device(s) if stolen, and to install your own keylogger in case anyone else has accessed your computer. The latter piece of advice is the same as the advice for Project Honeypot, but Incognito Toolkit’s advice is lacking in two ways. One, if your system is stolen, a keylogger alone won’t help. How would you retrieve the information? You need to add an element of syncing the data to another system or account. The second way is that it doesn’t necessarily identify the thief or attacker. Install webcam recording software too and also have it sync to another system or account. If storage is an issue, have it take photos every few seconds instead of recording video.
Another issue is what to do with systems that are obsolete or otherwise useless. Do not simply throw away or sell the electronics you don’t want anymore. Take out anything with memory and throw it in the microwave or burn it. If you don’t know what memory components look like, research them or throw the whole motherboard with storage drives in the microwave. No amount of reformatting actually works on hard-disk drives. Solid state drives are a different story, but they aren’t fool-proof either. Magnets, wood chippers, endless reformatting, etc. are solutions that aren’t 100% either. If you have access to large machinery like a wood chipper, I suggest smelting your drives instead of grinding them just like I don’t recommend paper shredding since they’re still pieces that can be recovered.
