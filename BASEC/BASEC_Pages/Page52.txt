CLOUD
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Many older power users will go on security rants about the problems with cloud technology. They’re right about your data being insecure in the same sense that you’re safe from “hacks” if you don’t own or use a computer. There are several cloud services that are secure, but you’d do best by encrypting files before sharing them across machines anyway. File encryption is perfect for this as well as using partition encryption on removable media such as UFDs and SD cards when sharing locally. However, sometimes you need to share data over an Internet connection and using Google Drive, Microsoft’s OneDrive, Box, and Dropbox are just bad ideas. The latter two are less secure that Google Drive and OneDrive. You do have encrypted options though.

BITTORRENT SYNC ------------------------------------------------------
BitTorrent Sync is not an encrypted cloud service in the least, but it offers what others do not: shortest-path transfer without cloud or uploading to 3rd party servers. The only time a 3rd party server is used is as a temporary relay server between two ends using VPNs. The data is immediately overwritten by other people’s data when your connection is disconnected and others use the server for the same purpose. There’s no file size limitation since all the files are saved on your own system and whatever devices are connected. For example, sharing files with friends is easiest with BitTorrent Sync. You’ll both have local copies and no one else. You’re not limited to the uploading and downloading bandwidth of a cloud service but your own ISP bandwidth. You can modify bandwidth used as well as how you share the files or folders connected, permissions of reading and writing, requiring users to authenticate files, expiration dates on links, and more. The premium version includes save space with selective sync, changing folder permissions at any time vs only before sharing, and with business use permitted since there’s also dedicated enterprise versions. It’s the alternative to cloud services to share files and it’s support covers Linux, Windows, OS X, FreeBSD, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Amazon’s Fire OS, and numerous NAS architectures.

TRESORIT -------------------------------------------------------------
Tresorit is a Hungary- and Switzerland-based, end-to-end encrypted cloud service that offers cross-platform support on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry. After the Snowden Revelations, the devs started a “hacking” contest to crack Tresorit’s encryption or otherwise exploit their cloud services. The reward was initially $10,000 which had risen to $25,000 and then $50,000 after a few months. After a well over a year, no one was able to crack the encryption. Tresorit has a sleek, easy-to-use design and used to offer free accounts. Unless you acted when the promotions occurred, you have to now pay to use Tresorit, but there are 14-day free trials. The premium account is $12.50 a month for 100GB storage, zero-knowledge syncing, equally secure across all devices, and offers version and activity history. My switch from my 15GB account to BitTorrent Sync only occurred since Tresorit doesn’t redownload or modify Tresorit files on Android after syncing so commonly used files would have to be downloaded again constantly. However, I still maintain my account for Project Honeydrive since it’s an excellent service worth using whether with free or premium accounts.

SPIDEROAK / SPIDEROAKONE ---------------------------------------------
SpiderOak is a US-based, client-side encrypted cloud service that offers cross-platform suppert with Linux distros Debian, Fedora, and Slackware, Windows, OS X, Android, and iOS. It’s been around for almost ten years, whereas Tresorit has for five, is somewhat open-source with plans to go fully open-source, and uses zero-knowledge privacy where only the users can view contents. It’s not wise to trust client-side encryption when end-to-end encryption is safer. SpiderOakONE is the Linux version of SpiderOak that’s built on top of Canonical’s discontinued UbuntuONE which is as visible in the syncing as it is in design. Beyond the 2GB of storage for a 60-day trial, SpiderOak comes in three tiers: $80 annually for 30GB, $130 annually for 1TB, and $280 annually for 5TB. If price is your only issue, then $130 for 1TB with SpiderOak is better than $150 for 100GB with Tresorit. However, if security is your issue, I advise using Tresorit instead since it uses end-to-end encryption and has been very transparent about the successful “hacking” contest.
One reason you would want to use SpiderOak over Tresorit, besides a free trial four-times as long, is the use of sharerooms. Tresorit users can’t share files with non-Tresorit users since an account is needed to view Tresorit links. However, this isn’t the same for SpiderOak. You can create sharerooms, or links to folders and / or files, that users can view over the web and download the contents if wanted. 
OwnCloud and SSH aren’t mentioned since OwnCloud has a learning curve and SSH is a secure way to share files, but it’s neither easy to use nor automate. Plus, OwnCloud is really just a client-server application where users have to build their cloud servers and sync data to it. In this regard, using Raspberry Pis to create an OwnCloud server and syncing with BitTorrent Sync is a popular project. However, this option is very unnecessary if you don’t need a centralized server for your own local files.
