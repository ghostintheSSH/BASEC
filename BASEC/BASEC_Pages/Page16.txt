FULL DISK ENCRYPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You’ve read me mention AES256 several times. Let me explain its importance in the shortest description I can imagine. Until quantum encryption exists, AES256 is impossible to crack. All the computers in the world attempting to crack AES256 using a strong password would take myriad lifetimes. Don’t misunderstand me. This chapter exists for a reason. AES256 might be uncrackable, but you’re the biggest vulnerability to any one system out there. Follow PERSEC and you might deserve your security and privacy yet. Another aspect discussed will be FDE, or full disk encryption. It’s used for securing an entire drive unlike system partition encryption. System partition encryption only encrypts the system partition and not the other partitions created by the OS or user during installation. For Windows, this means the restore and recovery partitions are vulnerable to attack. For Linux, this means the swap partition is vulnerable to attack. FDE takes care of this issue for almost all partitions. The boot partition is not encrypted by either system partition encryption or FDE so they it’s always vulnerable to attack. However, by moving the boot partition to a separate drive, you can have actual FDE and a fully secure OS. Project Linux Installation and Project Windows Installation will cover FDE setup for Linux users and Windows users.

DM-CRYPT -------------------------------------------------------------
DM-Crypt is not a downloadable tool or, I should say, is not a tool you should download. It comes pre-installed in the Linux kernel and DragonFly BSD. The BSDs are Unix-like systems like Linux, but we won’t be covering any *nix system outside of Linux. DM-Crypt is employs FDE, or full-disk encryption, partition encryption, RAID encryption, logical volume encryption, and file encryption using LUKS, or Linux Unified Key Setup, encryption. However, our focus is on FDE. The other aspects have a learning curve you won’t be able to obtain anytime soon (I sure still haven’t). The FDE option is extremely easy though since it only involves a few mouse clicks, but some operating systems are easier than others. Arch and Debian have less-that-easy installation processes, but Linux Mint and Ubuntu make it difficult for a new user to make mistakes. You will be asked during the installation after it detects what operating systems are on the drive selected if any if you want to install the OS normally or with encryption with LVM, or logical volume manager. If you choose to install with encryption, the installer will bring you to a partition editor where you can create, delete, and / or resize partitions. I suggest creating separate partitions for /tmp and /home. Don’t forget to add a swap partition if it’s not already listed. I also suggest moving the boot partition to a UFD, or USB flash drive, that you can hide so you can keep attackers out from all avenues. 

BITLOCKER ------------------------------------------------------------
BitLocker is an FDE and partition encryption tool for Windows systems like DM-Crypt is for Linux and it too comes preinstalled. The only issue is that it’s only fully available in Pro and Enterprise versions of Windows. It uses CBC, or cipher block chaining or XTS mode with 128- or 256-bit keys. BitLocker has three authentication mechanisms: transparent operation mode, user authentication mode, and USB key mode. Transparent operation uses a TPM, or Trusted Platform Module, chip to decrypt the system, but is vulnerable to cold boot attacks. User authentication mode uses pre-boot authentication with a PIN or password. USB key mode requires a UFD to be entered during pre-boot to unlock the OS. This isn’t the same as the USB idea previously mentioned in DM-Crypt or in Project Linux Installation, which moves the bootloader itself to a UFD. The USB Key Mode for BitLocker is a security key like Yubikey but on any UFD of your choice. Another issue with BitLocker is that, if you have a Microsoft account set up on your Windows system, Windows will store a copy of your encryption key on OneDrive. The reason for this is to help you decrypt the system in case you forget the password, but it’s safe to presume with all the heavy telemetry settings and strong partnership with NSA that this is not the only reason. It will be discussed further in the SYSSEC chapter under Windows, but you really shouldn’t set up your Windows system with your Microsoft account or have a Microsoft account for that matter. If you choose to set up Windows with your account anyway, use BitLocker to encrypt your system, and you don’t want Microsoft to have the encryption key, you can delete the link to the recovery key in OneDrive and use CMD to generate a new recovery key.
