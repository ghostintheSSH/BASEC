PHONES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Phones are as much a nuisance as wireless networks and email if not worse and smartphones are even worse than other cell phones in regards to security. If you can help it, never use a smartphone over a PC. However, that’s fairly unlikely like giving up email. Instead, there’s some advice you can mull over and decide if you want to stick with smartphones and secure them or move over to burner phones. Regardless of your choice, your use of cell phones can still be traced and you can still be found. Cell phones can be traced via triangulation without GPS enabled since you’re connecting to a cell tower in order to use the phone. A few tips for this are to carry your phone in an aluminum case when not in use or turn it off and remove the battery. Some phones don’t have removable batteries and using an aluminum case means you won’t receive any communication to the phone while the signal is blocked by the case. 
Like PCs, smartphones have OSes worth discussing. Blackberry has the best mobile security out of the three major phone operating systems, I haven’t tried the Turing or Black Phone, and the Amazon and Firefox phones are dead projects. Blackberry isn’t discussed because it’s a dying company and one that has managed to stay relevant by partnering with Google to produce Blackberry phones with Android for a secure, professional Android phone. This leaves the discussion to Android and how you can secure it, burner phones and how you can obtain them, and iPhone and why you shouldn’t use them.

BURNER PHONES --------------------------------------------------------
Burner phones are the best privacy-based mobile technology out there using satellite connections vs solely radio waves. They’re inexpensive, easy to use, and great for communication without the added vulnerabilities that smartphones offer. It’s the application of KISS, or keep it simple, stupid, while allowing calls and texts. Of course, using a payphone or friends phone when the occasion arises is an even easier way of staying private, but we’re working under the assumption that you need a phone in case of emergencies. Unfortunately, burner phones require some form of identification in order to activate one and this varies from state to state. First, use cash of the gift / prepaid card system previously discussed in PERSEC under Finances. Second, you can use a friend, pay a stranger, or wear a disguise to purchase one since there will likely be cameras in the store that records you actions there. Third, you can either use a friends’ phone or a strangers’ phone to receive a text from a friend that’s actually the activation text. Regardless, delete the message. Using email addresses instead of the phones in the third step is the easiest. Use the disposable email services or create a temporary, encrypted email on a live system or VM. If you choose this step, make sure to delete the VM when you’re done. I always advise defragging the disk and clearing up the free space when done so all traces of evidence are gone. The easiest way to go about this is to create a separate partition or use a separate drive, whether UFD or SD card, that’s large enough to house a Linux VM (Linux Mint is only 8GB when fully installed and Arch is less). The reason for this is so that you don’t spend a lot of time and resources using a disk freeing tool like Bleachbit for an entire drive. Also, you don’t need to use a disk defragging tool on flash memory like UFDs, SD cards, or SSDs. If you don’t know if you have an SSD or HDD, you most likely have an HDD so defrag. If you used an SSD or HDD with creating a partition, don’t forget to delete the partition and add it back to the original partition. 

iPHONE ---------------------------------------------------------------
Don’t ever use an iPhone. Apple doesn’t take security seriously, especially not as much as they take design and marketing. Even Snowden has stated that he will never use an iPhone. They’re very easy to track and break. As it turns out of late, they’re even easy to bypass the FDE used. As if using an iPhone wasn’t bad enough, what’s worse is jailbreaking an iPhone. Jailbreaking is not at all like rooting and unlocking an Android phone. Rooting involves obtaining root privileges or administrator privileges. Unlocking involves making the bootloader accessible to change. Both of these do not alter the security of the phone, but rooting can be detrimental if a user gives root permissions to a malicious app. Jailbreaking involves destroying all security protocols for increased customization and leaves the user open to attack by anyone. Over 95% of iPhones that have been jailbroken were reported to have been “hacked” in the past few years. It’s a bad idea to use an iPhone, but it’s a worse idea to jailbreak one.
