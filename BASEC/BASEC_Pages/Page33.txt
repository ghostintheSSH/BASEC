ANTI-MALWARE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Anti-malware and AVs, or anti-virus, solutions are the same thing with a different name for marketing purposes thank to ‘80s movies. This section really only matters for Windows users since Bitdefender on Linux is bad, Avast support on Linux is dead, and the only AV, or anti-virus, solution of note on Linux is clamav / clam-tk and it’s not really needed. In fact, most AVs aren’t essential if you conduct safe browsing habits, but you should still use it on Windows as an additional security layer. 

BITDEFENDER ----------------------------------------------------------
BitDefender is your best security suite option on Windows if you’re willing to pay for it. It’s as equally terrible at catching malware since malware definitions themselves are not great, but it comes with a plethora of security features worth exploiting. One of which is the Privacy feature. You can set BitDefender to stop any networking service from accessing your data based on the data you enter. It’s a catch-22 to enter your PII into this AV and trust that it’s secure and won’t use the data maliciously. If you’ve ignored the Finances in the PERSEC chapter and bought a year license with your banking or credit card, there’s no point in worrying about the suite not having the data you already gave it. However, if you do use it and you have a Google account with your actual PII set up, you’ll love how many notifications you’ll get about BitDefender blocking Google. Another great service is the app firewall built in that blocks certain apps from the network. Microsoft Office doesn’t need Internet access. I suggest trying to use it to block whatever telemetry services on Windows 10 that you can that were on the apps you couldn’t or wouldn’t delete. Their latest feature includes a vulnerability scan too! The security settings you can play with are very simple and straight forward. I’ve only mentioned some of the security features, but professional reviews constantly state how it destroys the other competitors.

AVIRA ----------------------------------------------------------------
Avira is your best free option for anti-malware security on Windows. Avira has finally been worth recommending to everyone. It was the most powerful AV, free and premium included), but it ate resources making systems unusable and had an older design that left many questioning whether it was a legitimate AV. For a while, Avira was updated with a lighter, sleeker design, but it was ineffective at removing malware like a Norton clone. Now it’s circled back and has been greatly recommended as a free AV solution, which now includes the firewall app that was previously only for premium users. What separates it from BitDefender is that it’s not a great security suite by comparison. However, it’s the second best choice and the first if you don’t want to spend anything. As previously implied, the other difference is that it’s more powerful for searching and removing malware. This is still true. I use both on Windows; Avira as an AV and BitDefender as a suite of other security apps.

NORTON ---------------------------------------------------------------
Norton is only mentioned for the same reasons why Windows is mentioned. Do not use these services if possible. Norton is terrible at detecting and removing malware. It’s even bad at other security functions! The last time I used Norton was in 2012 to remove programs it deemed as untrustworthy and potentially unsafe. It scanned itself as such, removed itself, and caused a BSOD, or blue screen of death. It was broken upon reboot. There’s so many jokes about how bad Norton is that it’s not funny to see someone using it. You’re a lot less safe than you realize.
