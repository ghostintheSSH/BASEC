TOR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tor, also known as The Onion Router, is an anonymous networking service meant to scramble and hide the identifying network information of its users. It works by encrypting data and the destination IP address multiple times and sends the data out to a relay server. Each relay server decrypts one of the encrypted layers and sends the data to the next relay server until it reaches the destination. These servers are communal and the philosophy behind Tor is that there’s safety in numbers; the more users that use Tor, the safer each Tor user is. However, this philosophy is better adopted my VPN servers since VPN servers are safer in comparison, especially considering how many VPN users outnumber Tor users. 

USE ------------------------------------------------------------------
There’s specific uses for Tor since it’s a unique networking service that calls attention to itself. The very first rule is to always use a VPN connection when using Tor. Your ISPs log which IP addresses are using Tor. They can’t see the traffic, but they can detect that Tor is used. VPNs masks this use since VPNs secure the tunnels and packets, not just the packets. Public connections are a different story and using Tor bridge relays is an alternative to using VPNs for the same effect. The second rule is to never use P2P services over Tor. It’s unsafe and ends up cracking your anonymity. The third rule is to only use Tor when needed. Constant use of Tor is just as identifying and suspect as using it over the Clearnet and with P2P services. Moderation is key for a great number of things in life; using Tor only when needed is one of those things. You can use it more than just when needed, but it should not be the primary browser you use for general browsing. That’s just bad PERSEC.

BROWSER --------------------------------------------------------------
I recommend using the Tor browser with Tor. It’s Firefox with TorButton, TorLauncher, NoScript, HTTPS Everywhere, and Tor proxy. Some users advise not installing plugins. I recommend this for the most part since those plugins will violate your anonymity for security. The preset extensions and safe browsing habits should be the only security you need and the habits aspect is covered by BASEC. However, if you use Tor Hidden Services, then I recommend installing one additional tool: Darkweb Everywhere. It’s a fork of HTTPS Everywhere that forces sites to use Hidden Services where applicable like HTTPS Everywhere does with HTTPS. I also have a couple more rules for Tor use but with the browser. The first is to never open anything downloaded via Tor while the Tor connection is still active. An alternative to this rule is to use PROJECT DEVICE PERSEC to mimic a VM used for general browsing but with general Tor browsing, move the downloaded file(s) to the host, and open there. For sake of being safe than sorry, it’s best you just close Tor to view the file(s). The second and final rule is to use Bitcoin for purchases. You can use prepaid cards, but it’s up to you to remember what cards are used for what purposes. Using a single prepaid card for purchasing a VPN subscription and this week’s groceries defeats the purpose. It’s easier to manage finances by only using Bitcoin over Tor and VPNs and disposable plastic over VPNs alone.
