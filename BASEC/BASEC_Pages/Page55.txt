VPN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
VPNs are another best friend along with wired networks. VPNs, or virtual private networks, can secure and encrypt network traffic and / or use proxy functionality to hide user geolocation data. Proxies are commonly used in schools to block site restrictions and VPNs have been used to commit “geolocation piracy” to bypass counterproductive geolocation restrictions to maximize on customer price gouging. You should really only use this for the good of privacy, but it and Tor has been used for evil. It makes someone conducting digital reconnaissance against your online accounts from the public IP information difficult without knowing how to track and crack the VPN service. For example, let’s say you use Twitter, you’ve left the security settings at default, and you don’t use a VPN or Tor to obfuscate your network information. Anyone can use Tinfoleak to extract your network and geolocation information down to your GPS coordinates to find the exact spot you were during your last tweet. VPNs are part of the dark net (like Tor is part of the dark web) through packet and tunnel encryption. If you want to find the best VPNs, TorrentFreak does an annual review. While PIA is touted by many as the best, cheapest, most secure, and most privacy-respecting VPN, PIA does support TorrentFreak which may lead to bias. 

PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS ----------------------------------------------
Private Internet Access is a great VPN subscription for $40 annually with P2P and VoIP support, PPTP, OpenVPN, L2TP / IPSec support, covers 5 devices simultaneously, SOCKS5 Proxy, unlimited bandwidth, and over 3,300 servers in 25 countries. PIA doesn’t keep logs from traffic and DNS data to metadata (which was seen when the FBI wasn’t capable of retrieving a suspects’ VPN logs), accepts Bitcoin and PIA gift cards, and doesn’t filter, monitor, censor, or interfere with user traffic. Additional layers of security include a kill switch to kill Internet traffic when the VPN is disabled, IPv6 leak protection, DNS leak protection, and mixes user traffic together to better obfuscate user traffic. The incident with the FBI was the very first incident reported that the FBI contacted PIA over user data unlike most popular Internet services. It’s best used with AES256, RSA4096, and SHA256. It’s versatile and lightweight. It’s not recommended if you’ve done PROJECT DEVICE PERSEC, but you can put PIA on your router so that all devices on the network uses the same VPN connection vs each computer using their own. However, this links your network traffic to a single VPN instance. I can’t justify the router use since I only have 4 systems with a constant VPN connection and 2 systems with VPN connection when used occasionally. Be careful using PIA’s kill switch with Bitdefender on Windows. Network loss will activate the kill switch, which Bitdefender interprets as an attack. The conflict causes a BSOD, or blue screen of death.

TORGUARD -------------------------------------------------------------
Torguard is touted as the rival to PIA for the title of the best, most secure, and privacy-respecting VPN. However, it costs $60, which is $20 more expensive than PIA. In fact, Torguard is almost identical to PIA so if any features are not explicitly mentioned here, know that’s because it’s the same as PIA. Torguard has over 1,600 servers in over 50 countries, uses up to RSA2048, accepts over 200 types of payment options with numerous cryptocurrency options, and was made for P2P use. Torguard also includes bundles of different services where the Torguard VPN includes the Torguard Proxy, the Torguard Proxy alone, Torguard email, or all three combined. In order to have SOCKS5, SSH, and HTTPS support, users must buy the full bundle, which appear to be popular and broken. I still recommend PIA over Torguard, but Torguard is the next best choice if you need multiple VPN accounts. Using the same service with multiple accounts may not be the best use of PERSEC depending on what you’re doing.
