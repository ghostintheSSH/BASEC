FINANCES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finances are always going to be a huge issue with PERSEC regardless of whether or not we can get you to stop posting PII to social media. It requires constant awareness and management. It’s best to never use your banking information where applicable and never accumulate an unmanageable amount of debt. Use cash when you go to restaurants since waiters and waitresses use your card outside your proximity. Use gift cards wherever possible so you never build up a profile on you on the services you use and the products you buy. You can grocery shop with gift cards, buy mobile apps, games, eat at restaurants, buy clothes, etc. They’re great at being disposable cash in card form. Wherever you manage your finances, remember these three principles: avoid managing finances online or through your phone, do not use mobile banking apps whatsoever, and, if you going to manage your finances online, then get a separate computer or create a VM with an account separated from all of your other accounts to conduct your management. Contrary to the anti-online banking principle, you should engage in paperless billing. There’s no real form of secure billing without moving to an advanced level of PERSEC with shell corporations, moving your assets to your shell corporation, and using mail drops over P.O. boxes. However, paper bills are a larger vulnerability to your privacy and security than paperless billing. For whatever paper billing you have, destroy what’s no longer needed with a cross-shredding paper shredder, soaking in water, or burning. I suggest the first and last for best results, but try not to use shredding alone since it still leaves a trail.

BANKING APPS ---------------------------------------------------------
We’ll cover why you shouldn’t use mobile computing over desktop computing in SYSSEC under Mobile, but it’s essentially that mobile OSes are not as secure as desktop OSes. Some of the banking apps have ridiculous permissions to use them such as being permitted access to your camera or microphone. Some permissions make sense, but others are just intrusive. While there are means of changing app permissions, which will be covered in SYSSEC under Mobile, it’s still an unnecessary vulnerability that’s on the one device that we seem to destroy all PERSEC, SYSSEC, and NETSEC principles. If you must bank online, don’t use SMS text alerts or banking apps. They may be convenient, but they’re dangerous and can be intercepted. The last thing you need is some snooping party to collect your login credentials and wipe your accounts because you wanted to check your Chase balance really quick on the Starbuck’s Wi-Fi. 

GIFT / PREPAID CARDS & CASH ------------------------------------------
These options are your best friends and you don’t even know how awesome all three can be when combined. Case in point, prepaid cards often require some other card to purchase it so it can be authorized. Did you know that if you wanted a $500 prepaid card that you could put $504.95 on a grocery store gift card, purchase the prepaid card placing $500 on it, and use the $4.95 to activate the prepaid card? It requires two transactions and less than 5 minutes. I will advise that you should only use prepaid cards when you can’t use cash or gift cards. One such case is with your VPN provider. If you can’t use Bitcoins, use prepaid cards. However, make sure each prepaid card is single-serving only. Don’t purchase a VPN subscription and then use the card to purchase Steam games. That links the VPN account to your gaming account. Your use for prepaid cards should be rare so your management of your cards should be great, otherwise you jeopardize the very anonymity you’re trying to achieve. 
Cash is your best friend for all in-store transactions, except be wary of how much you carry on your person because law enforcement will seize it under civil asset forfeiture under the assumption that the money is for drugs regardless of guilt or your record. They need a new Magaritaville since the last one doesn’t come with a salsa dispenser. Actually, you shouldn’t carry a lot of cash on you for a lot of reasons, but the previously mentioned is the most perverse reason yet. Instead, use gift cards. Most major retailers have a gift card of some sort and most large grocery stores carry an assortment. You can especially use grocery store gift cards to buy other gift cards that you may not want traced back to you if you couldn’t use cash to do the same. I suggest experimenting with what disposable plastic can buy what. 

BITCOINS -------------------------------------------------------------
Bitcoins are another form of anonymous payment, but aren’t as easy as using prepaid cards. Bitcoins are a well-known form of cryptocurrency using blockchains to store the public ledger of transactions. It’s a virtual, decentralized currency that can be mined in return for processing power to verify and record these transactions. However, it’s not as beneficial to mine these days as it has been in the past. There are a few rules I’ve come across when dealing with Bitcoins since, like everything else in PERSEC, it only takes one wrong move to unravel your anonymity. 
•Sell items online & accept Bitcoins to build a collection
•Purchase Bitcoins in face-to-face transactions
•Mine Bitcoins
•Use ZipZap to purchase Bitcoins with cash at participating local businesses & create a new, disposable email address with each purchase
•Use LocalBitcoins to buy or sell Bitcoins like it’s Craigslist
•Do NOT use traditional Bitcoin exchanges
•Use a disposable laptop, TAILS, Tor, and a public network for creating a Bitcoin wallet, then verify your IP is addressed without DNS leaks, download Bitaddress, and disconnect your Internet connection to create a Bitcoin wallet without safely
•Use services like Electrum for off-site Bitcoin wallets
•Use Bitcoin sharing & mixing services to destroy potential trace back to you since each transaction is stored in blockchain
•Use a VPN on whatever system on whatever network and not TOR to make purchases online using your Bitcoin wallet

There are other types of cryptocurrencies, there are lists of places that accept Bitcoin that you can research, and there are more, extensive rules to Bitcoin use beyond these basics. I will say that using Bitcoin to purchase VPN subscriptions is probably easier than using prepaid cards to do the same after you’ve become experienced with both methods.
